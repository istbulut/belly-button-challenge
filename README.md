# belly-button-challenge
In this assignment given by Birmingham University Data Bootcamp an interactive dashboard has been built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Firstly D3 Javascript library has been used to read in data from the URL. Then;

-A horizantal bar char is created with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

-A bubble chart is created that displays each sample.

-An individual's demographic information has been displayed. All plots are updated when a new sample is selected.
